# MVP Blueprint for Job Finder AI Agent System

## 1. High-Level Overview

### Purpose
The system aims to:
- Aggregate job postings from diverse sources.
- Normalize and store job data for efficient retrieval.
- Provide intelligent search and recommendations.
- Allow users to save and track job searches and listings.
- Automate data refreshes to keep listings current.

### Core Principles
- **Clarity**: Ensure each component has a distinct role.
- **Scalability**: Design for growth in data and users.
- **User-Centric**: Focus on user needs for job search and management.
- **Modularity**: Maintain independent yet cohesive components.

## 2. System Architecture

### Components
- **Data Ingestion**:
  - Collect data from APIs, RSS feeds, and websites.
  - Use existing frameworks and libraries for web scraping and API integration.
- **Data Cleaning & Normalizing**:
  - Implement agents to parse and clean data.
  - Store normalized data in a central database (SQL/NoSQL).
- **AI Search & Ranking**:
  - Develop AI-driven search and ranking algorithms.
  - Utilize existing AI libraries for keyword matching and summarization.
- **User Interaction**:
  - Build a user-friendly interface for search and job tracking.
  - Implement features for saving searches and receiving updates.

## 3. Implementation Details

- **Data Ingestion**:
  - Leverage existing tools for API and web data collection.
  - Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for data fetching.
- **Data Cleaning & Normalizing**:
  - Use data transformation libraries to standardize job listings.
  - Ensure data models conform to API and SDK requirements.
- **AI Search & Ranking**:
  - Integrate AI models for semantic search and recommendation.
  - Ensure models are trained on relevant datasets for accuracy.
- **User Interaction**:
  - Develop a responsive web interface using modern frameworks.
  - Implement backend services to handle user queries and data retrieval.

## 4. Development Guidelines

- Follow existing codebase conventions for naming and structure.
- Use version control (e.g., Git) for all changes.
- Work in a clean environment (e.g., virtualenv).
- Use the latest LTS version of Python.
- Ensure all data models and schemas are well-defined.

## 5. Testing and Deployment

- Implement unit and integration tests for all components.
- Use continuous integration tools to automate testing and deployment.
- Monitor system performance and user feedback for iterative improvements.

This blueprint provides a structured approach for developing the Job Finder AI Agent System, ensuring alignment with existing standards and user guidelines.
