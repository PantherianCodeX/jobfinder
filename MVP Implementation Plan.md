# Job Finder AI Agent System - MVP Implementation Plan

## Overview
This implementation plan outlines the minimum viable product (MVP) development strategy for the Job Finder AI Agent System. The MVP will focus on core functionality using the CrewAI framework while maintaining extensibility for future enhancements.

## MVP Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Essential Agent Setup (MVP Core)
**Objective**: Implement minimum required agents for job finding functionality

1. MVP Agent Configuration (`config/agents.yaml`)
   ```yaml
   job_searcher:
     role: Job Search Specialist
     goal: Find and collect relevant job postings from specified platforms
     backstory: Expert at discovering job opportunities
   
   data_processor:
     role: Data Processing Specialist
     goal: Basic cleaning and standardization of job data
     backstory: Skilled at organizing job information
   ```

2. Basic Test Implementation
   ```python
   # tests/test_agents.py
   def test_agent_creation():
       crew = Jobfinder()
       assert crew.job_searcher is not None
       assert crew.data_processor is not None
   ```

### Phase 2: Basic Tool Implementation
**Objective**: Create essential tools for job searching

1. MVP Tool Configuration (`config/tools.yaml`)
   ```yaml
   tools:
     - id: job_scraper
       name: Job Scraper
       description: Basic job scraping from primary platform
       class: jobfinder.tools.job_scraper.JobScraper
   ```

2. Core Test Cases
   ```python
   # tests/test_tools.py
   def test_job_scraper():
       scraper = JobScraper()
       results = scraper.run()
       assert len(results) > 0
       assert all(['title', 'description', 'url'] in job for job in results)
   ```

### Phase 3: Essential Task Setup
**Objective**: Implement core job finding workflow

1. MVP Task Configuration (`config/tasks.yaml`)
   ```yaml
   search_jobs:
     description: Search for job postings on primary platform
     agent: job_searcher
     expected_output: List of relevant job postings
   
   process_data:
     description: Basic data cleaning and standardization
     agent: data_processor
     expected_output: Formatted job data
   ```

2. Basic Test Implementation
   ```python
   # tests/test_tasks.py
   def test_basic_workflow():
       crew = Jobfinder()
       result = crew.search_jobs()
       assert result is not None
       assert 'jobs' in result
   ```

### Phase 4: MVP Integration
**Objective**: Create working end-to-end job finding system

1. Basic Crew Implementation (`crew.py`)
   - Implement simple workflow
   - Add basic error handling
   - Create data output structure

2. Essential Test Cases
   ```python
   # tests/test_integration.py
   def test_mvp_workflow():
       crew = Jobfinder()
       result = crew.crew().kickoff()
       assert result is not None
       assert len(result.get('jobs', [])) > 0
   ```

## MVP Testing Strategy

### Core Unit Tests
- Test basic agent functionality
- Verify essential tool operations
- Test primary task execution

### Basic Integration Tests
- Test simple workflow completion
- Verify basic data flow
- Test error handling for common cases

## MVP Development Guidelines

1. Code Organization
   - Follow CrewAI framework basics
   - Keep configurations simple
   - Focus on essential functionality

2. MVP Testing Requirements
   - Test core functionality
   - Ensure basic error handling
   - Focus on critical paths

3. Essential Documentation
   - Basic README.md
   - Core configuration documentation
   - Simple usage examples

## MVP Success Criteria

1. Essential Functions
   - Successfully find jobs from primary platform
   - Basic data cleaning and formatting
   - Simple output generation

2. Core Technical Requirements
   - Basic tests passing
   - Essential error handling
   - Clean, maintainable structure

3. MVP Performance
   - Reasonable response time
   - Basic job collection working
   - Stable operation

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Set up basic project structure
2. Implement core job searcher agent
3. Create basic job scraping tool
4. Test essential workflow

## Notes
- Focus on essential features only
- Keep implementation simple and extensible
- Follow CrewAI framework fundamentals
- Defer advanced features to post-MVP phases
