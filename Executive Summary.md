### Key Components

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Agents fetch job postings from external APIs or by scraping known job sites.
   - Data is batched or streamed into the system based on schedule or triggers.

2. **Data Cleaning & Normalizing**
   - A specialized agent consolidates the collected raw data into a consistent format (e.g., job title, company, location, salary, keywords, posting date).

3. **Storage**
   - A primary database (SQL or NoSQL) to store job listings, user preferences, and logs.
   - (Optional) A vector database or search engine (e.g., Elasticsearch) for advanced full-text search and recommendation.

4. **AI Search & Ranking**
   - An AI agent processes user search queries, ranks the matched results, and can incorporate user preference data (locations, roles, industries, etc.).
   - An AI Summarization Agent may refine job postings into short, user-friendly synopses or highlight relevant sections.

5. **User Interaction**
   - A front-end (web, CLI, or mobile) that shows job listings and allows users to refine searches, set up notifications, and manage favorites.

6. **Notifications & Reporting**
   - Agents automatically email or push notifications of new or high-match job listings to users.
   - Generate periodic reports (weekly summaries, recommended roles, etc.).

  - (Optional) A vector-based approach with embeddings from models like `Sentence-BERT` or `OpenAI embeddings` for semantic search.

- **Integration**:
  - Sits behind a simple REST endpoint or is callable via internal methods from the front-end or user-facing service.

### 3.5 AI Summarization Agent

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Summarizes or highlights relevant sections of the job description for quick reading.
  - Extracts the main responsibilities, qualifications, and perks.

- **Tools**:
  - A language model (OpenAI GPT, local LLM like Llama2, or other summarization frameworks).

- **Usage**:
  - Invoked on-demand when user requests a short summary or a “quick view” in the UI.
  - Could be used in batch for each job posting to store a summary version in the database.

### 3.6 Notification & Reporting Agent

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Monitors new job postings relevant to each user’s preferences.
  - Sends scheduled or event-based notifications (new matches posted today, weekly digest, monthly summary).
  - Generate analytics or stats (e.g., how many new postings in a given sector, average salary changes, etc.).

- **Tools**:
  - Email or push notification frameworks (SendGrid, Twilio, etc.).
  - Scheduling with Celery, cron jobs, or any background task framework.

## 5. Workflow Examples

### 5.1 Daily Data Refresh

1. **Trigger**: Cron job at 2am.
2. **Data Ingestion Agent** runs, calling each job API or scraper.
3. **Data Cleaning & Normalizing Agent** processes new postings.
4. **Records** are saved/updated in main database.
5. **Notification & Reporting Agent** sends out daily updates to subscribed users.

### 5.2 User Browsing & Searching

1. **User** visits the front-end and enters search query (e.g., “Remote Python Developer”).
2. **AI Search & Ranking Agent** fetches relevant postings from the database (with or without semantic search).
3. **AI Summarization Agent** returns short bullet points for each job.
4. **User** saves interesting postings; these are stored in `favorites`.

### 5.3 Automatic Summary on a New Post

1. **Data Ingestion Agent** finishes adding a new job record.
2. **AI Summarization Agent** automatically generates a summary snippet (optional step, can be on-demand as well).
3. **System** notifies relevant users if it matches their saved search preferences.

## 6. Technical Decisions & Recommendations

1. **Language & Framework**:
   - Python is a strong choice (due to rich AI ecosystem).
   - Node.js or Go also suitable for concurrency and performance in scraping.

2. **Database**:
   - Start with PostgreSQL (flexibility, robust features, good for indexing).
   - Consider additional index store (Elasticsearch) if advanced full-text search is a priority.

3. **Architecture**:
   - Microservices vs. Monolith: A monolithic approach can be simpler for an MVP or smaller user base, but microservices with separate containers for data ingestion, AI Summaries, and user front-end can scale better.

4. **Orchestration**:
   - Use a queue (RabbitMQ, AWS SQS) or Celery for long-running tasks like summarizing thousands of postings.
   - Cron-based triggers for daily or weekly ingestion.

5. **Security**:
   - Secure endpoints with authentication and authorization (e.g., JWT).
   - Store sensitive data (user info) in encrypted form.

6. **Caching**:
   - Caching repeated searches or popular queries can dramatically speed up user experience.
   - E.g., Redis or in-memory cache for top queries.
